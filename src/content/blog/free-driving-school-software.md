Wondering if you can run your driving school with **free software**? Here's what's available and when to pay for a proper solution.

## Can You Run a Driving School with Free Software?

Yes—with significant limitations. Free tools work for solo instructors with few students, but require more manual work.

## Free Options That Work

### Google Calendar

Good for basic scheduling. Share calendars and set up appointment slots.

**Limitations:** No student booking, no payments, no reminders.

### Google Sheets / Excel

Track students and basic records.

**Limitations:** Manual entry, no automation, error-prone.

### Free Scheduling Tools

Basic appointment booking with limited features.

**Limitations:** Usually 1 calendar, no vehicle management, no SMS.

## The True Cost of "Free"

- **Time** – More manual work
- **No-shows** – Without reminders, more missed appointments
- **Errors** – Manual systems cause double-bookings
- **Unprofessional image** – Students expect online booking

## When Free Makes Sense

- Just starting out
- Fewer than 10 students
- Don't need online booking

## When to Upgrade

- 5+ hours/week on admin
- No-shows costing money
- Students asking for online booking
- Adding instructors

For £29/month, proper software pays for itself in saved time and reduced no-shows.
