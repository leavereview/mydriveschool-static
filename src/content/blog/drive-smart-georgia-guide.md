If you operate a driving school in Georgia or are considering starting one, understanding the state's driver education requirements is essential. Georgia's graduated licensing system and driver education regulations have specific requirements that affect how you structure your programs and serve your students.

This guide covers what driving schools need to know about Georgia's driver education landscape, compliance requirements, and how to build a successful driving school business in the Peach State.

## Georgia's Graduated Driver's License System

Georgia uses a graduated driver's license (GDL) system designed to give new drivers progressive experience under controlled conditions.

### Stage 1: Instructional Permit (Class CP)

### Stage 3: Full Class C License

## Joshua's Law: Driver Education Requirements

Joshua's Law, named after Joshua Brown who died in a car crash at 16, mandates driver education for teen drivers in Georgia.

### Requirements

**For drivers under 18:**
- 30 hours of classroom instruction (or approved online course)
- 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training with certified instructor
- 40 hours of supervised driving with parent/guardian (6 at night)

**For drivers 18 and older:**
- No mandatory driver education
- Still must pass knowledge and skills tests

### Approved Programs

Driver education programs must be approved by the Georgia Department of Driver Services (DDS). This includes:

- Private driving schools
- High school driver education programs
- Online classroom instruction (ADAP courses)

### ADAP vs. Full Driver Education

**ADAP (Alcohol and Drug Awareness Program):**
- Satisfies classroom requirement
- Can be completed online
- Does not include behind-the-wheel training

**Full Driver Education:**
- Includes classroom/online instruction
- Plus 6 hours behind-the-wheel
- Comprehensive preparation

**Note:** Students often complete ADAP online then seek behind-the-wheel training separately. Driving schools can offer the driving portion independently.
