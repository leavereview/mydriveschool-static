Roundabouts are one of the most common places for driving test faults. They demand simultaneous lane selection, observation, signalling, and speed management — and many learner drivers approach them with anxiety that compounds the difficulty.

This guide covers everything you need to know: the rules, the technique for each type of exit, how to handle multi-lane and spiral roundabouts, and the 5-level DVSA progression framework so you know exactly when you're test-ready.

## What Examiners Look For

Examiners assess five things at every roundabout:

**Approach speed** — You should slow down appropriately as you near the roundabout, not brake sharply at the give way line. Approaching at the right speed gives you time to assess the traffic from the right.

**Lane selection** — Choosing the correct lane before the roundabout, based on the road markings and your intended exit, is assessed from the moment you see the roundabout signs. Getting into the wrong lane — or drifting between lanes — is a common source of faults.

**Observation** — Looking right as you approach and timing your entry correctly. The give way rule applies to traffic already on the roundabout from your right. Emerging when it isn't safe is one of the most serious faults you can make.

**Signalling** — Correct signals at the right time: indicating your exit approach, and cancelling signals promptly after taking your exit.

**Lane discipline on the roundabout** — Staying in your lane while on the roundabout, particularly on multi-lane or spiral roundabouts where lanes change their direction.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Roundabouts

### Level 1: Introduced
You understand that you must give way to traffic from the right and have seen the basic lane selection explained. Your instructor selects the lane and tells you when to go — your job is to steer and control the speed.

### Level 2: Helped
You're beginning to look right as you approach, but you need significant help with timing your entry — knowing when the gap is safe — and with lane selection. You might take the correct exit but signal late or not at all.

### Level 3: Prompted
You handle familiar, simple roundabouts with one or two exits — mostly independently. But on multi-lane roundabouts, busy junctions, or unusual layouts, you need prompting for lane choice or entry timing. Signals might be occasionally wrong or missed.

### Level 4: Independent
You navigate any roundabout confidently: standard, multi-lane, spiral, and mini roundabouts. Lane selection, observations, timing, and signals are all correct without instructor input.

### Level 5: Reflection
You read directional signs before the roundabout and plan your lane well in advance. You understand *why* lane discipline matters — preventing lane-change collisions on the roundabout — and you adapt confidently when other drivers make mistakes. **This is test-ready standard.**

## Roundabout Rules: Every Scenario

### Turning Left (1st Exit)

**Lane:** Use the left lane. On a single-lane approach, simply keep left.

**Signal on approach:** Indicate left before the roundabout.

**On the roundabout:** Keep left, keep the left indicator running.

**Exiting:** Take your exit, cancel the signal.

The most straightforward of the three. The main mistake here is failing to signal on approach, or signalling right and confusing drivers behind.

---

### Going Straight On (2nd Exit)

**Lane:** Usually the left lane, unless road markings say otherwise. On multi-lane roundabouts, you may need the left or right lane depending on markings — follow them.

**Signal on approach:** No signal — indicating left too early suggests you're turning left. Stay neutral.

**On the roundabout:** Pass the first exit without signalling. As you pass the exit *before* yours, signal left to indicate you're about to leave.

**Exiting:** Take your exit, cancel the signal.

The middle-exit scenario is where most learners make mistakes. The key rule: no signal on approach, then left signal *after* passing the previous exit.

---

### Turning Right (3rd Exit or Beyond)

**Lane:** Use the right lane on approach (unless signs or markings say otherwise).

**Signal on approach:** Indicate right before the roundabout.

**On the roundabout:** Keep right and maintain the right signal. Watch your left mirror as you approach your exit — check for vehicles that may be alongside you on the left.

**Changing position:** As you pass the exit *before* yours, check your left mirror and signal left to indicate you're about to leave, then move left to exit.

**Exiting:** Take your exit, cancel the signal.

The right-turn scenario requires the most preparation: approaching in the right lane, watching for lane-change opportunities on the roundabout, and checking for cyclists or vehicles on your left as you exit.

---

### Mini Roundabouts

The same rules apply — give way to the right, signal correctly, follow lane discipline. The key differences:

- The white circle must be driven around (if possible — you're allowed to mount it if the vehicle size makes it necessary)
- The approach speed needs to be lower as visibility and stopping distances are reduced
- On a crossroads-style mini roundabout, be alert: vehicles from multiple directions may be entering at the same time

---

### Spiral (Lane-Change) Roundabouts

Some larger roundabouts use spiral lane markings — the lanes change their direction as you travel around, guiding you to the correct exit without a lane change. These can be confusing because the lane you're in determines your exit, not which lane you move into.

**Key rule:** Follow the lane markings on the roundabout surface. Do not change lanes while on the roundabout unless a lane is ending. Trust the road markings and they'll take you where you need to go.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Entering when it isn't safe | Anxiety to move — waiting feels awkward | Treat the give-way line as a full stop if in doubt. A brief wait is far better than a collision or a serious fault |
| Wrong lane on approach | Not reading signs early enough | Look for the roundabout sign 200–300m ahead. Check for lane markings before you reach the give-way line |
| Signalling left on approach for straight on | Confusing "keep left" position with "turning left" | No signal for straight on until you've passed the exit before yours |
| Cutting across lanes on exit | Drifting right-to-left without checking mirrors | Mirror check before changing position to exit. Signal left *then* move, in that order |
| Forgetting to cancel the signal | Rushing — mental load is high on roundabouts | After taking your exit, cancel immediately. Build this as a physical habit |
| Stopping unnecessarily at a clear roundabout | Nerves — treating every roundabout as if traffic is coming | Look early. If the roundabout is clear from the right with no approaching traffic, you don't have to stop |

## Practice Tips

**Walk a roundabout before driving it.** If there's a roundabout near where you practice, walk it before your lesson. Standing in the middle (safely) or watching from the side gives you a completely different perspective on how lanes work.

**Learn to read directional signs.** Spend time studying roundabout directional signs on your commute or as a passenger. Knowing how to extract your lane from a sign in advance is the key to approach-lane selection.

**Practise entry timing, not just the manoeuvre.** Ask your instructor to park near a busy roundabout and have you practise the "look and go" decision — not the full roundabout, just the entry. This separates the anxiety of timing from the mechanics of lane selection.

**Spiral roundabouts need dedicated practice.** If there's a spiral roundabout on a likely test route, ask your instructor to take you through it several times. The lane-change logic is unintuitive at first but becomes automatic.

**Use the "would I be confident to do this alone?" test.** If you're not sure you're at Level 5, ask yourself: would I do this roundabout without any input? If there's hesitation, there's more practice needed.

## Track Your Progress

Our software tracks your roundabout progress across the 5 DVSA levels. After each lesson, your instructor records whether you're at Level 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 — and you can see exactly which aspects (entry timing, signalling, lane selection) still need work.
