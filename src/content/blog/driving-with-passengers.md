Passengers and loads change the nature of driving in ways that are easy to underestimate. A car full of friends feels different to drive — it stops more slowly, handles differently in bends, and introduces social dynamics that can subtly (or not so subtly) influence your decisions behind the wheel. DVSA Skill 26 assesses your ability to manage these variables safely, and for newly qualified drivers it is one of the most practically important skills to develop.

## What Examiners Look For

On your driving test, you will typically be carrying one passenger — the examiner. This is itself a form of assessment. Examiners are watching whether having someone in the car affects your composure, your observation, or your decision-making. Some learners become more hesitant with an examiner present; others become distracted by conversation or by wanting to explain their actions. Neither is helpful.

The examiner is looking for you to drive as though the passenger is simply there — not ignoring them, but not allowing their presence to alter your driving technique. If the examiner speaks to you during the test (to give directions or check your understanding), they expect you to respond briefly while keeping your primary attention on the road.

Vehicle loading is assessed more on theory than during the practical test itself, but examiners may ask Show Me Tell Me questions related to carrying loads, roof rack use, or towing. You should know how loads affect vehicle dynamics and what checks are required.

The wider context of Skill 26 is about decision-making under social influence. Peer pressure is a documented factor in young driver crashes — provisional data consistently shows that newly qualified drivers are significantly more likely to have an accident when carrying passengers of a similar age. Examiners and instructors want to see that you have internalised the understanding that passenger comfort and approval is irrelevant compared to vehicle safety.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Driving with Passengers and Loads

### Level 1: Introduced
You understand that passengers and loads affect your driving but have not yet practised managing these variables consciously.

### Level 2: Helped
Your instructor needs to remind you to check seatbelts, brief passengers, or adjust your driving style for additional weight.

### Level 3: Prompted
You generally manage passengers well but may occasionally need a reminder — for example, to check a passenger's seatbelt before moving or to increase following distance with a full car.

### Level 4: Independent
You complete all passenger and loading checks automatically, drive appropriately for the vehicle's load, and maintain your decision-making standards regardless of social pressure.

### Level 5: Reflection
You are at test-ready standard. You actively manage the passenger environment before moving, you have clear personal standards about what you will and will not do regardless of passenger pressure, and you can accurately predict how additional weight affects your vehicle's stopping and handling.

## Passenger Management Technique

The single most effective thing you can do before driving with passengers is to brief them before you start the engine. It takes ten seconds and sets clear expectations. "Seatbelts on please, and I need to keep focused on the road so keep the music reasonable" is not unreasonable — it is responsible driving.

You are legally required to ensure passengers under the age of 14 are wearing appropriate seatbelts or child restraints. For passengers over 14, they are personally responsible for their own seatbelt, but you should still check before moving.

Newly qualified drivers face a specific risk that the statistics make very clear. Research from the RAC Foundation shows that new drivers carrying same-age passengers are significantly more likely to crash than when driving alone. The social dynamic of wanting to appear confident, of responding to jokes or challenges, or of being distracted by conversation is real and well-documented. Being aware of this risk is the first step to managing it.

You cannot fail your driving test for something a passenger does, but you can fail for how you respond to distraction. If a passenger is distracting you during your test, it is acceptable to say "I need to concentrate right now" — an examiner will respect this far more than watching you drift across lanes.

## Vehicle Loading and Towing

A fully loaded car stops noticeably more slowly than an empty one. If you regularly carry four adults and their luggage, check your vehicle's Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) rating in the owner's manual — overloading a vehicle is illegal and invalidates your insurance.

Roof racks and rooftop carriers raise the vehicle's centre of gravity, making it more susceptible to crosswinds and body roll in corners. If you are driving with a roof load, take motorway on-ramps and corners more slowly than usual, and be especially aware on exposed sections of road.

Towing a trailer or caravan brings different rules. The maximum speed limit on a dual carriageway drops from 70mph to 60mph. You cannot use the outside lane of a three-lane motorway when towing. You may also need a category B+E licence endorsement depending on the weight of the trailer. Check before you tow.

For any load, check your tyre pressures. Most manufacturers specify a higher tyre pressure for a fully loaded vehicle — this information is typically found on a sticker inside the driver's door frame or in the owner's manual.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Being distracted by passengers | Natural social instinct | Brief passengers before moving; practise keeping conversation short while driving |
| Not checking all seatbelts | Assuming passengers have sorted themselves | Make a seatbelt check part of your cockpit drill every single time |
| Not adjusting following distance for load | Not thinking about vehicle physics | Remind yourself: more weight = more stopping distance needed |
| Responding to peer pressure | Wanting to appear confident | Internalise that refusing to speed IS confident behaviour |
| Using mirrors obscured by rear passengers or loads | Not noticing until on the road | Check all three mirrors are clear as part of your loading check |

## Practice Tips

**Drive with different passenger combinations.** Practise with one passenger, then two, then a full car. Notice how the car feels different — the steering, the braking, the general composure of the vehicle. This awareness is what allows you to adjust appropriately.

**Practise saying no in low-stakes situations.** Before you are in a real situation with passengers pressuring you to take risks, decide clearly in advance what your standards are. Rehearse the phrases you would use. Confidence under pressure comes from preparation.

**Load the car intentionally for a lesson.** Ask your instructor if you can add luggage or weight to the boot during a lesson to physically feel how stopping distances change. Experiencing the difference is more memorable than reading about it.

**Check your vehicle's tyre pressure chart.** Find out now where the tyre pressure information is for your training vehicle and what the loaded versus unloaded pressures should be. This is also a potential Show Me Tell Me question.

**Ask for feedback after carrying passengers.** After practising with friends or family in the car under supervision, ask your instructor specifically whether your driving changed with people present. Fresh eyes catch things you cannot see from the driver's seat.

## Track Your Progress

Rate yourself against the DVSA 1-5 scale after every lesson where you drive with others present. The goal is Level 4 — managing passengers and loads independently, without your driving standard dropping even slightly compared to solo practice. Many drivers reach test standard when alone but drop a level with passengers — catching this early is key.
