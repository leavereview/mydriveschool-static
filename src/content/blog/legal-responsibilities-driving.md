      text: "You must be named as a driver on a valid insurance policy before driving. Learners typically use either a dedicated learner driver policy or are added to a parent or instructor's policy. Driving uninsured carries a fixed penalty, points, and possible disqualification."

      text: "Any vehicle over three years old requires an annual MOT certificate. Road tax (Vehicle Excise Duty) must also be paid. Both can be checked online using the DVLA's free vehicle enquiry service — search the registration plate at gov.uk."

      text: "For the first two years after passing your test, accumulating 6 or more penalty points results in your licence being revoked — not reduced to 3 as it would be for an established driver. You would need to retake both theory and practical tests."

Legal responsibilities are the foundation of everything else in driving. Before you learn to steer, before you understand junctions, before you practise parallel parking — you must understand what it means to be a legally compliant driver on UK roads. DVSA Skill 1 covers this ground deliberately: a driver who understands their obligations is a more responsible driver, not just a more legal one.

## What Examiners Look For

Skill 1 is not assessed through a specific on-test exercise in the way that, say, reversing or junction observation is. Instead, it underpins everything. An examiner encountering a learner who has a strong grasp of their legal responsibilities will observe this in the quality of their decision-making throughout the test.

However, the Show Me Tell Me questions at the start of the test can touch on legal knowledge. Questions about whether a vehicle is roadworthy, or what checks you should make before driving, are directly connected to Skill 1. Your instructor may also discuss legal responsibilities during lessons and expect you to demonstrate understanding.

The new driver rules — specifically the six-point rule — are assessed implicitly throughout your training. An instructor who is helping you understand why speeding or using a mobile phone matters is teaching Skill 1 as much as any technical driving lesson. The consequences of poor decisions are part of legal responsibility.

Your examiner will also verify indirectly that your supervision arrangements are legal. On test day, if you are driving to the test centre under supervision, that supervisor must hold a full UK driving licence and be over 21. Your vehicle must display L plates. These are minimum legal requirements.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Legal Responsibilities

### Level 1: Introduced
You are aware that driving requires a licence and insurance but have not yet explored the specific requirements, rules, and consequences in detail.

### Level 2: Helped
You know the basic requirements but need your instructor to explain specific rules — for example, the difference between types of insurance, or what an MOT covers.

### Level 3: Prompted
You understand your legal obligations and can recall them when prompted, but may not have internalised them as automatic considerations in your driving decisions.

### Level 4: Independent
You can clearly explain all legal requirements for learner drivers, understand the new driver rules, and make driving decisions with an awareness of their legal and practical consequences.

### Level 5: Reflection
You are at test-ready standard. You can explain not just what the rules are but why they exist — understanding the relationship between legal requirements and road safety. You have also thought through how the six-point rule will affect your behaviour as a newly qualified driver.

## Your Legal Obligations as a Learner Driver

**Provisional licence**: You must apply for a provisional driving licence before you drive on a public road. You can apply at 15 years and 9 months and drive from age 17. The licence must be valid (not expired, not revoked). Carry it every time you drive — you can be asked to produce it.

**L plates**: Red L plates on a white background must be displayed on both the front and rear of the vehicle. If you are in Wales, you may use a red D (for Dysgwr, meaning learner) as an alternative. L plates must be removed or covered when a full licence holder drives the same vehicle.

**Supervision**: While learning, you must be supervised by someone who is at least 21 years old and has held a full UK driving licence for at least three years. Your approved driving instructor (ADI) or trainee instructor (PDI) qualifies automatically. A friend or family member supervising you must meet both age and licence requirements.

**Insurance**: At minimum, any vehicle you drive must have third-party insurance. Learner driver insurance policies are widely available — either as standalone policies or as short-term additions to an existing policy (often a parent's). Driving without insurance is a serious offence: six penalty points, a fine of up to £5,000, and possible disqualification.

**MOT and road tax**: Vehicles over three years old require an annual MOT. Road tax (Vehicle Excise Duty, or VED) must be current. Both can be checked using the DVLA's free online vehicle check at gov.uk — search the registration plate. An untaxed or un-MOTed vehicle cannot legally be driven on a public road (with very limited exceptions).

**The Highway Code**: Knowledge of the Highway Code is a legal requirement, not just a test formality. You are expected to know and follow it. The 2022 update introduced significant changes, particularly to the hierarchy of road users. Make sure you are using the current edition.

## After You Pass: The New Driver Rules

The moment you pass your driving test, your provisional licence is exchanged for a full licence — and a two-year probationary period begins. This period has different rules to those that apply to established drivers.

In the standard penalty points system, accumulating 12 or more points within three years results in a totting-up disqualification. In the first two years, the threshold is just six points. Six points — the equivalent of two mobile phone offences, or two moderate speeding tickets — means your full licence is automatically revoked.

Crucially, revocation is not the same as disqualification. You do not simply get your licence back after a ban. Your licence is revoked and you must retake both the theory test and the practical driving test before you can drive again. The costs, waiting times, and practical disruption are significant.

This rule exists because newly qualified drivers are statistically the most dangerous road users. Understanding it before you pass your test means you make better decisions on day one of driving independently.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Not knowing the 6-point new driver rule | It is not well publicised | Learn it now — it applies from the moment you pass |
| Assuming a parent's car insurance covers you | Some policies do; many do not | Phone the insurer directly and confirm before driving |
| Not displaying L plates on both ends | Forgetting the front L plate | Make a pre-drive checklist: front L, rear L, then get in |
| Thinking the supervisor needs to be an instructor | Common misconception | Any 21+ driver with 3+ years full licence can supervise |
| Not checking MOT/tax before driving an unfamiliar car | Assuming it is sorted | Takes 30 seconds at gov.uk — always check before driving a car you do not own |

## Practice Tips

**Check a vehicle's legal status before every supervised drive.** Get into the habit of checking MOT and road tax status for any vehicle you drive. It takes less than a minute at gov.uk and confirms you are legal before you start.

**Read the current Highway Code.** Not just the learner sections — the whole document. It is available free online. The 2022 update changed rules around cyclists, pedestrians, and road hierarchy that every driver needs to know.

**Understand your insurance policy in detail.** Ask to see the certificate of insurance for any vehicle you practise in. Check your name is on it, check the permitted use category, and check the named driver conditions.

**Have a conversation with your instructor about post-pass driving.** Specifically, discuss the six-point rule, common offences that generate points (mobile phone use, speeding), and habits that make newly qualified drivers safer.

**Know where your driving licence information is.** Register for a DVLA online account so you can see your licence status, check endorsements, and manage your details online. This also makes the post-test licence upgrade straightforward.

## Track Your Progress

Legal knowledge underpins every other driving skill. As you progress through your training, revisit Skill 1 periodically — especially after your theory test, and again as you approach your practical test. Rate yourself honestly: can you explain every item listed here without hesitation? Level 4 means yes.
