Night driving demands a higher level of concentration and a different set of skills compared to daytime driving. Reduced visibility, glare from oncoming headlights, and the way artificial light creates misleading shadows all combine to make driving after dark genuinely more hazardous. Understanding and practising DVSA Skill 24 will not only help you pass your test — it will keep you safe for the rest of your driving life.

## What Examiners Look For

The examiner marking Skill 24 is assessing whether you can adapt your driving appropriately to low-light conditions. They are not just watching for the mechanical act of switching headlights — they are looking at the whole picture of how you manage visibility and speed.

You should switch to dipped headlights at dusk without being prompted. Many learners wait until it is completely dark, but the Highway Code requires lights from sunset to sunrise and in any other conditions of seriously reduced visibility. An examiner who sees you driving in fading light with sidelights only will mark this as a serious fault.

Your use of full beam matters too. Examiners want to see you proactively switching to full beam on unlit roads when it is safe to do so — not just leaving it on dipped beam the whole time out of caution. Over-caution that reduces your visibility is itself a hazard.

Response to glare is another key element. When oncoming headlights appear, you should dip immediately and, if glare is severe, slow down and look towards the nearside kerb rather than staring into the light. Fixating on oncoming headlights is dangerous and will concern an examiner.

Finally, speed management is critical. Driving at 60mph on a dipped-beam country road when you can only see 30m ahead means you cannot stop in time if an obstacle appears. Examiners call this "over-driving your headlights" and it is a serious fault.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Night Driving

### Level 1: Introduced
You are aware that headlights must be used at night but need reminders about when to switch between dipped and full beam.

### Level 2: Helped
Your instructor needs to prompt you to use full beam on dark roads and to return to dipped for oncoming traffic.

### Level 3: Prompted
You generally use headlights correctly but occasionally need a verbal reminder — for example, forgetting to dip when a vehicle appears at distance.

### Level 4: Independent
You manage headlight switching smoothly and automatically, adjust your speed for visibility conditions, and handle glare correctly without any prompting.

### Level 5: Reflection
You are at test-ready standard. You proactively switch to full beam on unlit roads, dip immediately for oncoming traffic, use your speed to match your stopping distance, and scan ahead effectively despite reduced contrast and visibility at night.

## Headlight Technique

Always have your dipped headlights on from dusk to dawn — this is non-negotiable. In the UK, sidelights alone are not sufficient for driving at night.

On unlit roads where there are no vehicles ahead or oncoming within 100 metres, switch to full beam. Full beam extends your visible range from around 30m (dipped) to around 100m, giving you far more time to react to hazards. Many learners are reluctant to use full beam because they are not sure when it is safe — the rule is simple: if you cannot see other headlights within 100m in either direction, full beam is appropriate.

The moment you see oncoming headlights, dip. Do not wait until they are close. If you are blinded by someone else's full beam, slow down, avoid staring into the lights, and use the nearside white line or kerb as a reference point to maintain your position.

Wet roads at night create their own hazard. Reflections from puddles and road markings can be confusing, and pedestrians are much harder to see — especially those wearing dark clothing. Cyclists without adequate lights are almost invisible. Scan further ahead than you would in the day, and treat any movement at the edge of your headlight beam as a potential hazard.

Speed management at night is not about driving slowly — it is about driving at a speed where you can stop within the distance your headlights illuminate. On dipped beam, that means around 20-30mph on an unlit road unless you switch to full beam. Always ask yourself: could I stop in time if something appeared right at the edge of my headlights?

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Staying on dipped beam on dark country roads | Learners are unsure when full beam is appropriate | Remember the 100m rule — no vehicles in sight, use full beam |
| Not dipping for oncoming traffic | Forgetting or reacting too slowly | Look further ahead so you see headlights early and dip proactively |
| Driving too fast for headlight range | Habit from daytime driving | Ask yourself every few minutes: can I stop within what I can see? |
| Staring into oncoming headlights | Natural but dangerous instinct | Train yourself to look left at the nearside kerb until they pass |
| Not using headlights at dusk | Waiting until it feels "properly dark" | Use the rule: if you think you might need them, you do |

## Practice Tips

**Practice dusk and dawn driving specifically.** These transitional periods are when most headlight errors occur. Ask your instructor to schedule at least one lesson in fading light so you get used to judging when to switch on.

**Practise full beam switching on a quiet road.** Find a rural road with little traffic and deliberately practise switching between dipped and full beam smoothly, building the habit of scanning ahead for oncoming lights before making the change.

**Use glare management as a drill.** When a vehicle passes with bright headlights, practise immediately looking at the nearside kerb and maintaining your lane position — this is a real skill that takes repetition.

**Check your mirrors more frequently at night.** Headlights in your mirrors can be just as distracting as oncoming ones. Keep your interior mirror on the anti-dazzle position after dark.

**Build spatial awareness for stopping distances.** At 30mph on dipped beam, you have very little margin. Practise at lower speeds first and gradually build your confidence managing speed relative to visibility.

## Track Your Progress

Use the DVSA 1-5 scale to rate yourself after each night driving lesson. If you are consistently reaching Level 4 — managing headlights and speed independently without prompts — you are on track for test standard. Your instructor should be assessing this skill formally as part of your training record.
