Many learner drivers believe that matching the speed limit is the goal. In reality, DVSA Skill 11 — Use of Speed — is about choosing the right speed for the conditions at every moment of your drive. Getting this right is one of the clearest signals to an examiner that you are a safe, thinking driver.

## What Examiners Look For

Your examiner is watching whether you understand that the speed limit is a legal maximum, not an instruction to drive at that speed regardless of what is happening around you. They want to see you adjust your speed continuously as conditions change, not set the cruise control to 30 and leave it there.

Smooth acceleration and deceleration matter. Hard braking tells an examiner you reacted late. Coasting gently to a stop because you spotted a red light early tells them you were reading the road ahead. Both arrive at the same junction, but only one demonstrates the anticipation that good speed management requires.

Driving unnecessarily slowly is also a fault. If you sit at 18 mph in a clear 30 zone, you create a queue behind you and demonstrate a lack of confidence. The examiner will mark this as driving too slowly or creating an obstruction. The skill is finding the pace that is appropriate — not the fastest, not the most cautious, but the right one.

You must also show that you adapt to weather and visibility. In heavy rain, stopping distances roughly double. On a foggy morning, your speed should allow you to stop within the distance you can see clearly. Examiners conduct tests in all weather, and they notice when a candidate ignores conditions.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Use of Speed

### Level 1: Introduced
Your instructor has explained what appropriate speed means and why the limit is not always the right speed. You are beginning to understand the difference.

### Level 2: Helped
You can maintain a reasonable speed but rely on your instructor to tell you when to slow for hazards, bends, or junctions. You are not yet reading the road independently.

### Level 3: Prompted
You recognise most situations that require a speed reduction but need occasional reminders — for example, approaching a narrow road or a school crossing. Your acceleration is becoming smoother.

### Level 4: Independent
You select appropriate speeds without prompting in most situations. Your acceleration and braking are smooth, and you rarely need intervention.

### Level 5: Reflection
Test-ready standard. You instinctively match speed to conditions, can explain your decisions, and your overall pace is confident yet never rushed. You drive at 40 mph where it is safe to do so and slow to 15 mph around a tight bend without being asked.

## Understanding Appropriate Speed

The speed limit tells you the fastest you may legally travel on that road in ideal conditions. It says nothing about whether that speed is appropriate right now. A 60 mph national speed limit road becomes a 20 mph road in practice when there is a tractor ahead, mud on the surface, and poor visibility around a bend.

Match your speed to these factors:

**Road width.** Narrow lanes require slower speeds because the margin for error when meeting oncoming traffic is reduced.

**Visibility distance.** Your speed should allow you to stop within the distance you can see is clear. If a bend limits your view to 40 metres, you must be able to stop in 40 metres.

**Weather conditions.** Rain, ice, and fog all increase stopping distances and reduce tyre grip. Reduce your speed accordingly — not just slightly, but meaningfully.

**Pedestrian presence.** Near schools, bus stops, and residential streets, pedestrians may step out unpredictably. A lower speed gives you more reaction time.

**Following distance.** If traffic is heavy and the gap ahead is short, you need a lower speed to maintain a safe separation. Never let the pressure of traffic behind you push you faster than is safe.

**When to slow without being told.** You should automatically reduce speed when approaching any junction — even if you have priority — on the approach to any bend that limits your forward view, when passing parked vehicles that might conceal pedestrians, and when you see children near the pavement.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Driving at 30 in a 40 zone | Anxiety about going "too fast" | Trust your observations — if the road is clear and dry, use the limit |
| Braking hard at junctions | Reading the road too late | Look further ahead and start easing off the accelerator earlier |
| Matching speed to traffic rather than conditions | Social pressure from cars behind | Your speed is your decision — examiners penalise being pushed |
| Constant speed through varying conditions | Treating the limit as the target | Ask yourself at every hazard: "Is my current speed appropriate?" |
| Rushing after a slow section | Overcompensating when road clears | Accelerate gradually and smoothly, not all at once |

## Practice Tips

**Practice commentary driving.** Say aloud what you see and what it means for your speed — "parked van ahead, pedestrians may step out, easing off." This builds the habit of continuous assessment.

**Use quiet roads to find your range.** On a familiar road, practice driving at 5 mph below the limit in poor conditions and note how much more time you have to react. Then do the same in ideal conditions at the limit to feel the difference.

**Record your trips with a dashcam.** Review footage with your instructor to identify moments where your speed was late to respond to a hazard. Video is the clearest feedback tool available.

**Work on smooth pedal use.** Set a target of never making a passenger feel a jolt. Smooth inputs require earlier reactions, which forces you to read the road further ahead.

**Practice in different weather.** If you have only driven in dry conditions, ask your instructor to arrange a lesson in rain. Experiencing the difference in grip and stopping distance is more effective than reading about it.

## Track Your Progress

Before your next lesson, ask your instructor to score your Use of Speed on the 1–5 DVSA scale and identify one specific situation where you chose the wrong pace. Targeting a single scenario each lesson is faster than trying to improve everything at once.
