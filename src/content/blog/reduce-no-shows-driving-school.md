No-shows cost driving instructors thousands every year. Here's how to dramatically reduce them.

## Why Students No-Show

- Forgot the lesson
- Plans changed but didn't tell you
- Found cheaper instructor
- Got nervous

## Solutions That Work

### 1. Automated Reminders
Send reminders 24 hours and 2 hours before lessons. SMS works better than email.

### 2. Require Deposits
Charge a booking deposit. Even £10 dramatically reduces cancellations.

### 3. Clear Cancellation Policy
Make your policy clear at booking. 24-48 hours notice is standard.

### 4. Easy Rescheduling
Make it easier to reschedule than to cancel. Online rescheduling is key.
