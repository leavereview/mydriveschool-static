Every drive puts you in contact with other people using the same road — some in vehicles, some on bikes, some on foot, and occasionally on horseback. DVSA Skill 12 is about reading their behaviour, predicting what they might do next, and responding in a way that keeps everyone safe without causing anyone to alter their course because of you.

## What Examiners Look For

The examiner's primary concern is whether you treat vulnerable road users with the care they need. Cyclists, pedestrians, motorcyclists, children, and horse riders are all at far greater risk than a driver inside a car, and the examiner expects you to acknowledge that by adjusting your position, speed, and timing around them.

They are specifically watching for situations where you force another road user to react. If a pedestrian who has started crossing on a side road has to step back to let you turn, that is a fault. If a cyclist has to brake because you pulled in front of them, that is a fault. The standard is that your driving should not inconvenience anyone who is already on the road.

You are also assessed on your response to the behaviour of other drivers. Safe driving is not just about following the rules yourself — it includes responding calmly and safely when others behave unpredictably, cut in front of you, or fail to signal. The examiner wants to see that you have a margin of safety built in that absorbs the errors of others without requiring an emergency response from you.

Awareness of vehicle blind spots matters here too. Large lorries and buses have significant areas they cannot see from their mirrors, and your examiner will notice if you sit in those zones at junctions or when following.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Dealing with Other Road Users

### Level 1: Introduced
Your instructor has explained the hierarchy of road users and why some need more protection than others. You understand the concept but have not yet applied it consistently on the road.

### Level 2: Helped
You respond correctly when your instructor points out a cyclist, pedestrian, or horse ahead. You are not yet identifying them independently early enough to plan your response without prompting.

### Level 3: Prompted
You spot most vulnerable road users in time, but occasionally need a reminder — for example, to check your left mirror before a left turn at a junction with a cycle lane. Your responses are generally correct when prompted.

### Level 4: Independent
You consistently identify and respond to all types of road users without prompting. Your positioning and timing allow interactions to flow smoothly.

### Level 5: Reflection
Test-ready standard. You automatically adjust your driving style based on the road environment — slowing near schools without being asked, positioning to protect cyclists before they are close to you, and leaving the right amount of space for every interaction. You can also explain your decisions if asked.

## Technique: Road User by Road User

### Cyclists

Cyclists are among the most frequently encountered vulnerable road users in UK towns and cities, and interactions with them are a common source of test faults.

**Overtaking.** The Highway Code recommends a minimum of 1.5 metres when passing a cyclist at speeds up to 30 mph, and more space at higher speeds. Do not attempt to squeeze past if there is not enough room — wait until the road ahead is clear enough to move fully into the opposite lane if needed.

**Left turns at junctions.** Always check your left mirror before turning left, even if you have already checked it for your mirror-signal-manoeuvre routine. Cyclists can move quickly up your nearside in the time between your initial check and the turn itself. If one is there, wait.

**Cycle lanes and advanced stop lines.** Do not enter a cycle lane unless it is permitted by dashes rather than a solid white line. At traffic lights, stop behind the advanced stop line — not in the cycle box.

**Dooring risk.** When passing parked vehicles, check for doors opening and position accordingly. A driver who opens a door without looking forces a cyclist into your path.

### Pedestrians

**Pedestrians crossing on turns.** When turning into a side road, pedestrians already crossing have priority. Do not wave them across — this can cause confusion. Simply wait until they have cleared your path.

**School zones and bus stops.** Slow and be prepared for pedestrians — particularly children — to step into the road without looking. Position yourself so you can stop safely if needed.

**Zebra and pelican crossings.** Give way to pedestrians on zebra crossings as soon as they set foot on them. At pelican crossings, do not move off while the amber light is flashing if pedestrians are still crossing.

### Large Vehicles

Do not position your car alongside a lorry or bus at a junction. Large vehicles may need to swing wide to turn, and the driver may not be able to see you. Hold back and give them the space they need to complete the manoeuvre.

When following a large vehicle, increase your following distance to maintain visibility ahead. The extra stopping distance is a secondary benefit — the primary one is being able to see and plan.

### Horses

Horses are unpredictable around engine noise and sudden movements. Pass them wide — at least as wide as you would pass a cyclist — and slow to around 10 mph. Do not accelerate sharply until you are well past them and around any bend that might carry the sound back.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Turning across a cyclist on the nearside | Forgetting a final left-mirror check before the turn | Add a specific left-mirror check as the last step before every left turn |
| Cutting in front of pedestrians crossing on turns | Prioritising your own movement over theirs | If in doubt, wait — they always have priority once crossing has begun |
| Sitting in a lorry's blind spot at junctions | Positioning based on car-sized vehicles only | If you cannot see the driver's mirrors, they cannot see you — move back |
| Passing horses too close or accelerating past them | Treating them like a slow-moving vehicle | Drop to 10 mph, pass wide, wait before accelerating |
| Reacting sharply when another driver cuts in | Insufficient following distance | Maintain a gap that absorbs others' errors without emergency braking |

## Practice Tips

**Narrate interactions.** As you drive, name what you see: "cyclist ahead, checking left mirror, giving 1.5m clearance." Speaking the steps aloud reinforces the routine until it becomes automatic.

**Drive in different environments.** Town centres at school-run times, rural lanes with horse riders, and busy roundabouts each present different challenges. Varied practice builds adaptability.

**Study the Highway Code chapters on vulnerable road users.** Rules 160–218 cover pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, and animals. Understanding the rules reinforces why the technique works.

**Ask your instructor to set specific scenarios.** Request a lesson focused on junctions with cycle lanes, or a route that passes equestrian routes, so you can practice targeted interactions with guidance immediately available.

## Track Your Progress

After each lesson, ask your instructor to identify one interaction where your response to another road user was late, too close, or caused them to adjust. Reviewing one specific moment per lesson builds awareness faster than general feedback.
