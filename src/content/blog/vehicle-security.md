      text: "Every time the car comes to a complete stop — at traffic lights, when waiting, when parking — apply the handbrake. In an automatic, select Park (P) instead of or in addition to the handbrake. This prevents the vehicle rolling if your foot slips or you are struck from behind."
    - name: "Select neutral (or Park) before switching off"
      text: "In a manual car, select neutral before switching off the engine. In an automatic, select Park (P). Leaving the car in gear without the engine running is not a safety substitute for the handbrake, though on steep hills you may want both as a precaution."
    - name: "Switch off the engine and remove the key"
      text: "Turn the ignition off and remove the key. In a push-button start vehicle, ensure the engine is off before opening the door. In the UK, leaving your engine running unattended on a public road is a fixed penalty offence under the Road Traffic Act."

      text: "Before opening the driver's door, check the left door mirror and blind spot for cyclists, motorcyclists, and pedestrians. The car door opening into a cyclist's path (known as 'dooring') is a common serious accident. Open the door using the opposite hand to encourage you to turn and look — the 'Dutch reach'."

Vehicle security might seem like a mundane topic compared to roundabouts or motorway driving, but it is assessed on your test and it connects to a genuinely important set of habits. An unsecured vehicle causes accidents — rolling into traffic, collisions at junctions from slipping out of gear, cyclists injured by opening doors. DVSA Skill 4 is the discipline of finishing a drive safely, which matters as much as everything that happened during it.

## What Examiners Look For

The examiner will observe how you secure the vehicle at the end of your test, and will also note how you stop and apply the handbrake throughout — at traffic lights, when waiting at junctions, and when asked to pull up during the test.

The most common test fault related to vehicle security is failing to apply the handbrake correctly at the end of the test. Many learners, relieved that the drive is over, stop the car but forget the handbrake before the engine is off. This is a minor fault. If the examiner has to remind you or if the car rolls after stopping, it becomes more serious.

During the test, every time you pull up and stop, the examiner is watching whether you apply the handbrake or leave your foot on the brake. Foot on the brake alone is acceptable at a temporary stop (like a short traffic light), but pulling up at the kerb and simply holding the footbrake while everything else is done around you suggests an incomplete routine.

Opening the car door safely at the end of the test is also assessed. The examiner will watch whether you check your mirror and blind spot before opening the driver's door. Swinging it open without checking — even in a quiet test centre car park — demonstrates a habit that, elsewhere, would risk a collision with a cyclist.

The examiner will also note whether you leave the engine running when stationary for extended periods, or whether you switch it off appropriately. Leaving the engine running at a level crossing, for example, or at a long wait while passengers board, is unnecessary and contrary to good practice.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Vehicle Security

### Level 1: Introduced
You understand that vehicles must be secured before leaving but have not yet developed the systematic routine for doing so correctly every time.

### Level 2: Helped
Your instructor needs to remind you to apply the handbrake at stops, to select neutral before switching off, or to check before opening the door.

### Level 3: Prompted
You complete most of the routine correctly but need occasional prompts — for example, a reminder to check the mirror before opening the door, or to apply the handbrake at traffic lights for stops longer than a few seconds.

### Level 4: Independent
You apply the handbrake automatically at all appropriate stops, select neutral or Park correctly, switch off and remove the key when leaving the vehicle, and check before opening the door — all without any prompting.

### Level 5: Reflection
You are at test-ready standard. Vehicle security is a seamless part of your driving routine. You can explain why each element matters, including the legal obligation around leaving engines running and the specific risk posed by dooring cyclists.

## Stopping and Securing the Vehicle

Every stop falls into one of two categories: temporary (traffic lights, waiting at a junction) or final (parking, ending a journey). The security procedure differs slightly.

For a temporary stop at traffic lights lasting more than a few seconds, apply the handbrake and select neutral in a manual car. This means if you are hit from behind, your foot will not be jolted off the clutch and into a vehicle in front. It also reduces fatigue and is better for the clutch. In an automatic, keep your foot on the footbrake — the vehicle will hold in Drive (D) — or select neutral (N) for a longer wait.

For parking or ending a journey, the full sequence is: footbrake down, vehicle stopped, handbrake on, neutral selected (or Park in an automatic), engine off, key removed. In that order. Each step has a reason — the handbrake before neutral ensures the car is secure before you remove your foot from the brake; neutral before engine off prevents inadvertent engine braking issues.

On a steep hill, you may want to leave the car in gear as a secondary precaution, with the wheels turned towards the kerb (or away from the kerb when facing uphill, so the car rolls into the kerb if the handbrake fails). These are good habits but do not replace the handbrake.

## Leaving the Vehicle Safely

Once the car is secured, leaving it safely is a separate discipline. In the UK, the Dutch reach is increasingly advocated: open the driver's door with your left hand (right-hand-drive vehicles) rather than your right. The reaching motion naturally causes you to turn your body, which brings the left door mirror and the area behind you into view. This is a simple and effective way to build in a mirror and blind spot check before the door opens.

If you are on a road with active traffic (rather than a car park), this check is especially important. Cyclists travel at 15-20mph — at that speed, a car door opened without warning gives them almost no time to react. The consequences can be severe.

Removing valuables and locking the vehicle are also part of Skill 4. These are habits rather than test items, but your instructor may discuss them. Do not leave bags, phones, satnavs, or laptops visible in a parked car. Remove or cover them. Use the boot rather than the rear seat. Anti-theft habits established early in driving tend to persist — and they can prevent costly and distressing incidents.

## The Law on Leaving Engines Running

Under the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) (Fixed Penalty) Regulations 2002, it is an offence to leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily on a public road. A fixed penalty notice can be issued. This applies if you are waiting outside a school, sitting in traffic for an extended period, or stopped at the kerb with the engine idling.

The regulation is increasingly enforced in air quality management zones and around schools. Beyond the legal aspect, unnecessary idling wastes fuel and increases emissions. Switching the engine off for any stop of more than a minute is good practice.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Forgetting handbrake at end of test | Relief and distraction after test drive | Make handbrake the very first thing after stopping — before anything else |
| Opening door without checking mirror | Habit from passenger behaviour | Practise the Dutch reach every time you leave a car, not just during lessons |
| Leaving engine running while waiting | Not thinking about it | Adopt a rule: engine off for any stop over 60 seconds |
| Not selecting neutral before engine off | Rushing the end-of-journey routine | Say the sequence aloud until it is automatic: handbrake, neutral, off, key |
| Forgetting to check all passengers' doors are closed | Only checking from driver's perspective | Look at the door light indicator on the dashboard before moving off |

## Practice Tips

**Apply the handbrake at every stop, without exception.** Whether it is a traffic light, a level crossing, a petrol station, or the end of the journey — get into the habit of applying the handbrake every time the car stops. Over-application in training becomes correct application habitually.

**Practise the Dutch reach on every exit.** When getting out of a car — during lessons, when practising with family, at any time — use your opposite hand to open the door. This simple habit takes a few weeks to become automatic and then lasts a lifetime.

**Time your end-of-journey sequence.** Handbrake — neutral — engine off — key out. Do it the same way every time. When it becomes a sequence rather than a checklist, you are less likely to miss a step.

**Drive an automatic if possible as a comparison.** The Park (P) position on an automatic gearbox is a positive lock that prevents the car rolling in either direction. Understanding the difference between this and neutral in a manual helps clarify why gear selection matters at the end of a journey.

**Know your vehicle's anti-theft features.** Steering lock, immobiliser, alarm — know what your vehicle has, how it activates, and how to test it. This is part of Skill 4 in the broader sense and is useful knowledge regardless of test outcome.

## Track Your Progress

Vehicle security habits are assessed throughout your test, not just at the end. Every stop is an observation point for the examiner. Aim for Level 4 — applying the full routine automatically at every stop — before your test date. This is one of the few skills where reaching Level 4 early in training is entirely possible, and it builds good foundations for everything that follows.
