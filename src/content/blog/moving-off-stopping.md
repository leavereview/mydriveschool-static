Moving off and stopping sounds simple, but the examiner will assess this skill from the moment the test begins to the moment the car parks at the test centre. It is not a box-ticking exercise at the start — it is a continuous standard that runs through every junction, every traffic light stop, and every hazard throughout the full 40 minutes of your test.

Getting this skill to an automatic, confident level is one of the highest-return activities in driver training. It builds clutch control, observation habits, and the ability to stop safely and precisely — all of which feed into dozens of other skills.

## What Examiners Look For

The examiner wants to see a full and genuine observation routine before the car moves. The DVSA's POM routine — Prepare, Observe, Move — is the standard, and skipping any element of it is a serious fault if it puts another road user at risk.

Before moving, they expect you to check the interior mirror, both door mirrors, and take a right-shoulder blind spot check. If there is any traffic, cyclists, or pedestrians that could be affected, you should wait — not rush and hope for the best.

Signalling is assessed on whether it is necessary and timely. Signalling when no other road user can benefit from the information is unnecessary. Failing to signal when it would warn someone is a fault.

When stopping, the examiner checks that you choose a safe, legal position. Stopping opposite a junction, on a bus stop, or within the zigzag lines at a crossing are common serious faults. A good stopping position is close to the left kerb (roughly 30cm), parallel, and away from restrictions.

Clutch control throughout is observed. Stalling on a busy road is usually a minor fault on its own — but stalling because of poor preparation is more concerning to an examiner than stalling due to nerves.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Moving Off and Stopping

### Level 1: Introduced
The pupil can identify the controls needed to move off and understands the POM sequence in theory. They may need the instructor to operate some controls while they observe.

### Level 2: Helped
The pupil attempts to move off with active support — the instructor may manage the handbrake, remind them to check blind spots, or take control to prevent a stall.

### Level 3: Prompted
The pupil completes the routine but requires verbal prompts: "check your blind spot," "a bit more gas," or "remember to signal." Observations may be rushed or incomplete without a reminder.

### Level 4: Independent
The pupil moves off and stops without any instructor input. Observations are thorough and the sequence is consistent. Minor errors occur occasionally but do not require intervention.

### Level 5: Reflection
Test-ready standard. The pupil's POM routine is automatic and thorough. They adapt their approach to the situation — busier roads get more time for observation, hill starts use the correct technique — and they can explain their decisions.

## The Technique in Full

### Preparing to Move Off

Select first gear before releasing the handbrake. Bring the clutch up to the bite point — the point where the bonnet rises very slightly and the engine sound deepens. Keep your right foot on the accelerator with a gentle amount of gas to prevent stalling.

Do not select gear, find bite and immediately move. Hold the preparation for a moment while you complete your observation.

### Observing Before Moving

The sequence is: interior mirror → right door mirror → right blind spot (look over right shoulder). On a busy road or where cyclists may be near, add a left check as well. If a pedestrian is stepping off the pavement, wait. If a car is approaching from behind, wait until it is clearly safe.

Only when the checks are complete should you signal (if needed) and begin to move.

### Moving Smoothly

Release the handbrake and bring the clutch up steadily — not all at once, not in a series of jerks. Add gas progressively as the car begins to roll. Aim to be in second gear by about 15mph.

A common error is releasing the clutch too quickly when anxious to get away, causing a lurch or a stall. Slow down the clutch release mentally: "up slowly, car moving, a little more gas, up a little more."

### Stopping Safely

Plan your stop well in advance. Identify a suitable position — left side of the road, 30cm from the kerb, away from junctions, not blocking a driveway, not on restrictions. Signal left if pulling across from the driving lane.

Check mirrors (interior, left door mirror), reduce speed progressively with the brake, press the clutch as you slow to walking pace, stop smoothly. Apply the handbrake, select neutral, cancel the signal.

### Moving Off and Stopping on Hills

**Uphill**: Requires more gas than a flat road and a higher bite point. Find the bite point, add a little extra gas, release the handbrake smoothly. The car should begin to creep forward before you release the handbrake fully — this prevents rolling back.

**Downhill**: Use the footbrake rather than the clutch to control your speed. Find the bite point, handbrake off, let the brake control your speed as you ease away. Add gas once the car is moving.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Moving without a blind spot check | Rushing or forgetting the full sequence | Use a mantra: "Mirror, mirror, blind spot" every single time |
| Stalling when moving off | Releasing the clutch too quickly or too little gas | Hold the bite point longer; add gas before releasing handbrake |
| Stopping too close to a parked vehicle | Focusing on the kerb, not the full picture | Look for gaps in parked cars well in advance and plan a stop |
| Stopping on yellow lines or zigzags | Not spotting road markings in time | Scan ahead 50–100 metres for restrictions whenever pulling over |
| Rolling back on a hill start | Not enough gas, or handbrake released too early | Find bite point first, add gas until engine note changes, then handbrake |

## Practice Tips

**Use the POM sequence as a verbal checklist.** Say "Prepare — gear, bite, gas. Observe — mirror, mirror, blind spot. Move — signal, handbrake, clutch." Saying it aloud builds it into your automatic routine far faster than thinking it silently.

**Practise hill starts on quiet roads only at first.** Find a gentle gradient on a residential road with no traffic pressure. Repeat five clean hill starts before moving on. Confidence on hills is built through repetition, not theory.

**Practise stopping positions with your instructor marking them.** After each stop, your instructor should tell you the distance from the kerb and whether the position is legal. Aim for consistent 20–30cm stops, parallel to the kerb.

**Count your observation check.** A thorough blind spot check takes about one second. If you are completing it in a fraction of a second, it is a head wobble, not a check. Slow it down and actually look.

## Track Your Progress

Moving off and stopping is one of the first skills taught and one of the last to be fully refined. Pupils often plateau at Level 3 — technically capable but still needing the occasional prompt. The jump from Level 3 to Level 4 comes from deliberate repetition across different road conditions: hills, busy roads, narrow streets, and car parks.
