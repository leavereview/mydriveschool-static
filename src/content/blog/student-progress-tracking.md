Driving schools that track student progress consistently see higher pass rates. Here's why it matters.

## The Problem with Guesswork

Without proper tracking:
- Students don't know where they stand
- Instructors forget what was covered
- Test readiness is a guess

## What to Track

- Skills checklist (mirrors, signals, manoeuvres)
- Hours completed
- Weak areas needing work
- Mock test results

## Benefits of Tracking

### For Students
- Clear progress visibility
- Motivation to improve
- Confidence for test day

### For Instructors
- Structured lesson planning
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Higher pass rates

## How to Implement

Use [driving school software](/driving-school-software/) with built-in progress tracking. Students see their progress through their portal, and you have clear records for every lesson.

[Try MyDriveSchool.Software](/contact/) and see how progress tracking transforms your teaching.
