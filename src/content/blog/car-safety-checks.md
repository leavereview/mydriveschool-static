The Show Me Tell Me section of the UK driving test carries one minor fault if answered incorrectly — a small penalty for a small exercise. But the underlying knowledge it tests matters far beyond test day. A driver who does not know how to check their tyre tread, spot low brake fluid, or find the screen wash reservoir is a less safe driver. DVSA Skill 2 is about building the habit of vehicle awareness that will serve you throughout your driving life.

## What Examiners Look For

At the start of your practical driving test, the examiner will ask you two vehicle safety questions: one "tell me" question (answered verbally while stationary before driving) and one "show me" question (demonstrated while you are driving).

The tell me question is asked before you start the engine. The examiner wants a clear, specific answer — not a vague one. "I'd check the oil level using the dipstick" is correct. "I'd look at it somehow" is not. You do not need to physically perform the check for tell me questions, but your description should demonstrate that you actually know how to do it.

The show me question is asked while you are driving, typically early in the test. You will be asked to demonstrate something without stopping — for example, "Show me how you would wash and clear the rear windscreen." You should be able to operate in-cabin controls (rear wash/wipe, heated rear screen, demister) without taking your eyes significantly off the road.

Both questions together count as one assessable item. If you get both wrong, it is one minor fault. Getting the show me wrong and then having other minor faults in the same category cannot stack these — the single minor is the maximum penalty for the Show Me Tell Me section.

However, failing these questions indicates to the examiner that you may not be ready to drive independently. It is worth taking them seriously.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Car Safety Checks

### Level 1: Introduced
You are aware that vehicles require regular checks but have not yet learned the specific locations, procedures, or correct levels to look for.

### Level 2: Helped
Your instructor needs to guide you through each check, pointing out locations and explaining what to look for.

### Level 3: Prompted
You can perform the checks with occasional prompts — for example, you know where the dipstick is but need reminding which marking indicates the correct maximum level.

### Level 4: Independent
You can check all fluid levels, tyres, and lights without guidance, explain the checks verbally with confidence, and recognise when a vehicle may not be roadworthy.

### Level 5: Reflection
You are at test-ready standard. You perform safety checks automatically before driving and can answer any of the 20 Show Me Tell Me questions clearly and accurately. You understand not just where to check but why each check matters.

## The Essential Safety Checks

**Engine oil**: The dipstick is usually marked in yellow or orange and has a circular handle. Remove it, wipe it clean, reinsert fully, then remove again and read the level. The oil should sit between the MIN and MAX markings. If it is below MIN, top up with the correct grade of oil (check the cap or manual). Oil that is very dark or has a milky appearance may indicate a problem — tell your instructor.

**Coolant**: Find the expansion tank (a translucent plastic reservoir near the radiator). The correct level is between the MIN and MAX marks on the outside of the tank. Only open the coolant reservoir cap when the engine is cold — opening it when hot releases pressurised steam. If the level is consistently dropping, there may be a leak.

**Brake fluid**: Located in a small translucent reservoir, usually near the back of the engine bay on the driver's side. The level should be between MIN and MAX. Brake fluid that is very dark may need replacing. A dropping brake fluid level can indicate either normal brake pad wear or a leak — both should be investigated.

**Screen wash**: The reservoir is usually identifiable by a windscreen symbol on the cap. Fill it with screen wash diluted according to the season (summer/winter concentrations differ). Plain water is not adequate — it freezes, does not clean effectively, and can damage the pump.

**Tyres**: The minimum legal tread depth is 1.6mm across the central three-quarters of the tyre and around the entire circumference. Use a 20p coin — insert it into the tread grooves. If the outer band of the coin is visible, the tyre is at or below the legal limit and must be replaced. Also check the tyre sidewalls for cuts, bulges, or embedded objects. Check tyre pressure using a gauge at a petrol station — the correct pressure for your vehicle is shown on a sticker inside the driver's door frame or in the owner's manual. Pressures differ for front and rear, and may differ for loaded versus unloaded vehicles.

**Lights**: Walk around the vehicle before driving to check all lights work. Headlights (dipped and full beam), sidelights, brake lights, indicators (all four), hazard lights, reversing lights, and rear fog lights. For brake lights, ask a helper to stand behind the car, or reverse towards a wall and check the reflection when you press the pedal.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Not knowing where the fluid reservoirs are | Never looked under the bonnet | Open the bonnet at your next lesson and locate every reservoir physically |
| Giving vague answers to Tell Me questions | Not practising the specific answers | Learn the 20 standard questions and rehearse answers aloud |
| Not knowing the minimum tyre tread depth | Just not been taught it | Remember 1.6mm / 20p coin test — this is also a theory test topic |
| Confusing engine oil and coolant reservoirs | They look similar from above | Identify them by their distinctive caps (oil cap usually has an oil can symbol) |
| Not checking brake lights | Hard to see yourself | Always use a helper or a wall reflection — never assume |

## Practice Tips

**Open the bonnet with your instructor at the start of a lesson.** Rather than just talking about where things are, physically point to and identify every reservoir. Do this on at least two different vehicles if possible, since layouts differ.

**Practise the 20 Show Me Tell Me questions with a revision app or flashcards.** There are dedicated apps and YouTube videos covering all 20 current questions. Aim to answer each one without hesitation.

**Do a tyre check on the training vehicle.** Ask to use a tyre pressure gauge during a lesson and physically check all four tyres. This makes the check real rather than theoretical.

**Ask your instructor to run the show me question during a drive.** You need to demonstrate controls while moving. Practise operating rear wash/wipe, hazard lights, demisters, and other in-cabin controls without looking at them.

**Create a pre-drive checklist card.** Write down the five key checks (oil, coolant, tyres, lights, screen wash) and keep it in your bag. Checking it before supervised drives builds the habit that will serve you for years.

## Track Your Progress

By the time you reach test standard (Level 4), you should be able to answer any of the 20 Show Me Tell Me questions without hesitation and perform any physical check correctly on your own. Practise with your instructor on multiple vehicles so you are not thrown by a different layout on test day.
