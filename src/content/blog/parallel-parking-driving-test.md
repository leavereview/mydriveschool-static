Parallel parking is one of the three parking manoeuvres you might be asked to perform on your UK driving test. Around one-third of candidates are asked to parallel park, so there's a meaningful chance it will come up on your test day.

The good news: you're not expected to be perfect. Examiners assess safety, control, and observation — not whether you finish within six inches of the kerb. Understanding this takes most of the pressure away.

This guide walks through exactly what examiners look for, how to progress through all 5 DVSA skill levels, and the most common mistakes to avoid.

## What Examiners Look For

When you're asked to parallel park during your driving test, the examiner assesses four things:

**Accuracy** — You should finish reasonably close to and parallel with the kerb. "Reasonably close" means within about two car widths in the initial stages, closing to within a couple of feet by the end. You won't fail for being slightly wide — you'll fail for being so far out that you're still in traffic.

**Control** — The examiner wants to see smooth clutch and steering inputs throughout. Jerky movements, stalling, or rushing suggest you haven't mastered the skill at a level appropriate for independent driving.

**Observation** — Before reversing and throughout the manoeuvre, you must check all mirrors and your blind spots. Missing observations is the single most common reason for failing a parallel park.

**Safety** — If any vehicle, cyclist, or pedestrian approaches while you're manoeuvring, you must stop and allow them to pass. Causing another road user to stop or swerve is a serious fault.

You won't fail for needing to reposition. Taking an extra move to straighten up, or adjusting slightly forward and back, is expected and perfectly acceptable — provided each adjustment includes proper observations.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Parallel Parking

The DVSA's Ready to Pass framework uses a 5-level system to measure your progress on every skill. Here's how those levels apply specifically to parallel parking:

### Level 1: Introduced
You've seen the manoeuvre demonstrated and understand the basic steps. When you attempt it, your instructor guides you through every movement — when to start steering, how far to turn, when to straighten up. You're focusing on understanding the process rather than executing it smoothly.

### Level 2: Helped
You can initiate the manoeuvre and handle some of the steering independently, but you still need help with reference points or correcting your angle mid-manoeuvre. You're starting to feel the difference between when the car is at the right angle and when it isn't.

### Level 3: Prompted
You can perform the parallel park mostly independently in familiar, quiet conditions — but you occasionally need a prompt about observations, or a reminder to check blind spots before reversing. You might be consistent on one side of the road but struggle when the space is on the right, or when there's passing traffic.

### Level 4: Independent
You can parallel park confidently in a range of situations — different-sized gaps, slight inclines, varying traffic conditions — without any instructor input. You complete all observations correctly as a matter of habit.

### Level 5: Reflection
You understand *why* each step matters, not just what to do. You can adapt when the gap is tighter than usual, when the road cambers differently, or when you need to position the reference vehicle on the other side. You self-correct instinctively. **This is the standard you need for your test.**

## The Technique: Step by Step

### Setting Up

Pull up alongside the target vehicle (the car you're parking behind), leaving about a metre's gap between your car and theirs. Your bumpers should roughly align — don't stop too far forward or too far back. Apply the handbrake.

Before you move: check your interior mirror, right door mirror, and look over your right shoulder for passing traffic. Check your left door mirror and left blind spot for cyclists. Only begin reversing when it's safe.

### Phase 1: The Initial Reverse

Select reverse gear and begin reversing slowly — this is a clutch-control manoeuvre, not a brake-control one. Your speed should be walking pace or slower throughout.

As you move back, keep the steering wheel straight until your car's rear is roughly level with the back of the target vehicle. The reference point varies by car — your instructor will help you find the right one for the vehicle you're learning in.

Keep checking your mirrors throughout this phase. If any vehicle is approaching, stop and wait.

### Phase 2: The First Steer

Once at your first reference point, apply full lock towards the kerb (left lock if parking on the left side of the road).

Continue reversing slowly. Watch your right door mirror — you're looking for the target vehicle to appear in a way that tells you you're at the right angle, typically about 45 degrees to the kerb. Again, your instructor will give you the specific reference point for your car.

Continue checking all mirrors. If a vehicle passes behind you, you may need to pause or straighten temporarily.

### Phase 3: The Counter-Steer

At the second reference point — typically when you can see a specific amount of road in your left door mirror — apply full lock in the opposite direction (right lock for a left-side park).

This straightens the car up and tucks the front end towards the kerb. Continue reversing slowly until the car is parallel with the kerb, then straighten the steering.

### Finishing

Once parked, apply the handbrake and select neutral. Take a moment to assess your position: are you reasonably close to the kerb? Is the car parallel? If you need to adjust, you can — just remember to do a full observation check before each movement.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Finishing too far from the kerb | Applying the counter-steer too early — the car hasn't reached the right angle before straightening | Wait for the full reference point before turning. Trust the process even when it feels like you're going to hit the kerb |
| Hitting or mounting the kerb | Turning too much on the second steer, or not counter-steering in time | Your first steer should be full lock — no more. If you see the kerb approaching in your left mirror, apply counter-steer earlier |
| Not checking blind spots | Focused on steering and speed control — observations fall away under pressure | Make observations *before* you move each time. Build the habit in every practice session, not just when you remember |
| Finishing at an angle | Rushing the final phase — not giving the counter-steer enough time to work | Slow down even more in the final phase. The slower you go, the more control you have |
| Ending up too far forward | Not reversing far enough before the first steer | Your starting position matters. Pull level with the target vehicle and get it right before you even start reversing |
| Stalling during the manoeuvre | Releasing the clutch too quickly at slow speed | Keep the clutch just above or at the bite point throughout. This is a clutch-control exercise — use the footbrake to slow, not the clutch |

## Practice Tips

**Start in a quiet car park with cones.** Before doing it on a real road, practise in an empty car park using cones or marker bags to represent the target vehicle. This removes traffic anxiety and lets you focus purely on technique.

**Use consistent reference points.** Ask your instructor to identify two or three clear visual reference points specific to the car you're learning in. Don't try to judge angles freehand until you have the reference points working reliably.

**Vary the gap size.** Once you can park in a "perfect" gap (about 1.5 car lengths), practise in tighter gaps — about 1.25 car lengths. This builds adaptability.

**Practise on both sides.** Most learners only practise parallel parking on the left. On your test, the examiner may ask you to park on the right — so make sure you've done it in both directions.

**Do it on a slight incline.** Flat-ground parking is straightforward. Introduce a gentle hill once you've mastered flat ground.

**Do observation checks out loud.** In early practice, say "left mirror, right mirror, left blind spot, right blind spot" out loud before each reverse. This cements the habit before you stop narrating.
