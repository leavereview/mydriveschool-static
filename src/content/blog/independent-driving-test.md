Since 2017, the independent driving section has been one of the most discussed parts of the UK driving test. It lasts up to 20 minutes — around a third of your total test time — and is specifically designed to assess whether you can navigate real roads without being guided turn by turn. Four out of five tests now use a sat nav rather than road sign following, but the underlying skill being assessed is the same: can you make safe decisions while managing a route independently?

## What Examiners Look For

The examiner is not testing your navigation skills. They do not care whether you take the optimal route or whether you miss a turning. What they are assessing is whether your driving standard remains safe and consistent while your attention is partially directed at route following.

The distinction matters enormously. Learners who understand this approach independent driving with confidence — they know a wrong turn is not a failure. Learners who misunderstand it approach it with anxiety, which leads to exactly the kinds of unsafe decisions that do cause failures: taking a junction at speed, making a late turn without proper mirror-signal-manoeuvre, or pulling out without adequate observation because they are rushing to correct a navigation error.

Examiners are also checking that you maintain full situational awareness while following the sat nav. You should be scanning mirrors, checking junctions, and reading the road in exactly the same way as during the guided section of the test. If your observation deteriorates because you are focused on the sat nav screen, that is assessable.

Finally, examiners are watching for appropriate responses when the sat nav and the road conditions conflict. A sat nav may give an instruction to "turn right" at a junction where a give way line, a red light, or oncoming traffic makes that impossible right now. The correct response is to wait safely and proceed when clear — not to follow the instruction blindly or to panic because the sat nav is "wrong."

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Independent Driving

### Level 1: Introduced
You understand that the driving test includes an independent section but have not yet practised following a route without guidance.

### Level 2: Helped
Your instructor needs to supplement the sat nav with additional prompts, or you need reminders to maintain observation while navigating.

### Level 3: Prompted
You can follow a sat nav or road signs but occasionally need a prompt — for example, to check your mirrors before acting on an instruction, or to slow down when approaching an unfamiliar junction.

### Level 4: Independent
You follow sat nav instructions smoothly, maintain full observation and road awareness throughout, and respond calmly when you miss a turn or the instructions are unclear.

### Level 5: Reflection
You are at test-ready standard. Navigation feels like a background task rather than the primary one. Your driving standard is identical whether you are receiving instructions turn by turn or managing your own route. You can explain why calm, safe driving matters more than perfect navigation.

## Sat Nav Technique

The DVSA uses a TomTom sat nav on most tests. The examiner will set the destination before the independent driving section begins, and will mount the device on the windscreen in a position where you can see it without significantly adjusting your gaze from the road.

You are expected to glance at the sat nav to gather information, not to study it. The device gives both visual and audio instructions. Use the audio — listening for "in 200 metres, turn right" is far less distracting than reading the screen. If the audio gives you sufficient notice, you should be able to plan your manoeuvre (check mirrors, position, signal) in exactly the same way as when given a verbal instruction by your instructor.

When you miss a turning, continue driving safely in your current lane. Do not brake sharply, do not change lanes abruptly, and do not stop in a dangerous position. The sat nav will recalculate within a few seconds and give you a new instruction. The examiner has seen this happen hundreds of times and it carries no penalty. A sharp late turn, however, absolutely does.

One in five tests still uses road sign following. In these cases, the examiner will give you an instruction such as "follow the signs for Town X" or "take the next road on the right and then follow signs for the town centre." If you are uncertain, you may ask the examiner to repeat the instruction — once. If you become genuinely lost, pull over safely and indicate that you are not sure. The examiner will help you.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Panicking after missing a junction | Misunderstanding that navigation errors fail tests | Remind yourself: wrong direction is fine, unsafe driving is not |
| Following the sat nav into an unsafe manoeuvre | Treating it as an authority rather than a guide | You are the driver. The sat nav advises; you decide |
| Neglecting mirrors while reading the sat nav | Cognitive load of navigation | Use sat nav audio so your eyes stay on the road |
| Braking sharply for a missed turn | Instinct to fix the navigation error immediately | Let the sat nav recalculate; continue smoothly |
| Not asking for clarification when genuinely lost | Worry it will look bad | Asking is a sign of good judgement — unsafe guessing is not |

## Practice Tips

**Drive using sat nav deliberately during lessons.** Ask your instructor to set a destination on a real sat nav during lessons so you get used to the sound and visual layout before test day. Familiarity removes anxiety.

**Practise missing turns intentionally.** Have your instructor set a route and then deliberately miss a turning to experience what happens next — the sat nav recalculates, the world does not end, and you continue safely. This single exercise removes most of the panic associated with this section.

**Learn common road signs for directions.** Even if your test uses sat nav, you need to understand direction signs and their colours (blue for motorway, green for primary routes, white for local). Practice identifying them while out driving.

**Maintain your mirror routine during navigation.** Every time you receive a sat nav instruction, your response should still follow mirror-signal-manoeuvre. Practise this until it is habitual so that navigation instructions slot into your existing process.

**Drive without instructor guidance in lesson areas.** Ask your instructor to sit quietly for ten minutes while you navigate a familiar area independently. This builds the confidence of being responsible for your own route without the safety net of continuous guidance.

## Track Your Progress

The independent driving section is specifically logged as Skill 27 in the DVSA's Driver's Record. Rate yourself after practising: are you at Level 3 (needing occasional prompts) or Level 4 (fully independent)? The goal before test day is consistent Level 4, including when things go slightly wrong mid-route.
