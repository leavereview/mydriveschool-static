More driving test faults are recorded at junctions than at any other type of road feature. Emerging without adequate observation, approaching at the wrong speed, or misjudging priority at a crossroads — these are the errors that end driving tests prematurely every day. Understanding exactly what the examiner expects at a junction, and building the correct habits through methodical practice, is one of the highest-impact things you can do to prepare for your test.

## What Examiners Look For

Junction handling is assessed across several distinct areas, and the examiner will be watching all of them simultaneously from the moment you identify the junction ahead.

**The MSPSL routine** — Mirrors, Signal, Position, Speed, Look — is the systematic framework you should apply at every junction approach. Examiners are not looking for robotic adherence to a checklist, but they are checking that each element is genuinely present. Missing the mirror check before signalling, or positioning before checking mirrors, will attract attention. The routine exists because it represents the safest possible approach to any junction — use it every time.

**Speed on approach** is one of the most commonly faulted elements. Approaching a junction too fast means you arrive at the give way line without adequate time to assess the situation and stop safely if needed. Examiners record this as a fault even if you ultimately emerge safely, because the situation was not handled with appropriate caution. Conversely, slowing too aggressively or unnecessarily blocks following traffic and can cause a fault for undue hesitation on the other side of the scale.

**Effective observation before emerging** means genuinely looking and waiting until you are certain it is safe — not glancing and hoping. At a closed junction (where you cannot see far enough to judge the road until you reach the line), you must stop, look right, look left, look right again, and only emerge when you have confirmed it is clear. At an open junction (where visibility is good on approach), you may be able to emerge without stopping, but only if you are absolutely certain. If in doubt, the correct action is always to stop.

**Responding to other road users** means emerging at a time and speed that does not force any vehicle to change speed or direction for you. If a car on the main road has to brake because you have emerged, that is a serious fault — because it is genuinely dangerous. The standard is not whether you physically make it out of the junction; it is whether you emerged safely and without affecting others.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Junctions

### Level 1: Introduced
You have been shown junction procedure for the first time. You understand the basic concept of giving way and the need to observe, but you require significant guidance to apply the MSPSL routine in a real situation.

### Level 2: Helped
You can attempt to handle a junction but need physical or navigational assistance from your instructor — help with gear selection, reminders to look, or assistance with positioning — to manage it safely.

### Level 3: Prompted
You apply the MSPSL routine adequately but need verbal reminders to check mirrors before signalling, to slow earlier, or to look more thoroughly before emerging. The skill is developing but is not yet fully automatic.

### Level 4: Independent
You handle junctions consistently without prompts, applying the full MSPSL routine, choosing an appropriate speed, looking effectively, and emerging only when it is safe to do so. This is the test standard.

### Level 5: Reflection
You handle junctions to test standard and can evaluate your own performance accurately — recognising, for example, that you approached a particular junction slightly too fast or that your observation at a closed junction could have been more thorough.

## Open vs Closed Junctions

One of the most important concepts in junction handling is the distinction between open and closed junctions, because your approach speed and the decision to stop or proceed depends on it.

**An open junction** is one where you can see clearly along the main road in both directions well before you reach the give way line. Because you have the information you need early, you can make a rolling assessment as you approach. If the road is clear and it is safe to go, you may emerge without stopping — but only if you are certain.

**A closed junction** is one where buildings, hedges, parked vehicles, or the road layout prevent you from seeing the main road until you are right at the give way line. Here, you must treat the approach as though the road may not be clear and be prepared to stop. Once stopped, lean forward if necessary to look along the main road before emerging. Never inch forward into the path of traffic to see — stop, look, wait until the view is complete and the road is clear.

## Crossroads: Priority and Unmarked Junctions

At a crossroads where you have give way lines or traffic lights, priority is clear. But many crossroads — particularly in residential areas — are unmarked. At an unmarked crossroads, no driver has automatic priority. The safest approach is to slow significantly, be prepared to give way to any vehicle already approaching or crossing, and only proceed when you are certain it is safe.

**Right turns at crossroads** introduce a further complication: you must give way to oncoming traffic before turning. At a busy crossroads, this can mean waiting for a gap. Position yourself at the centre of the junction, wheels straight (so that if you are hit from behind, you are not pushed into oncoming traffic), and wait for a safe opportunity to complete the turn.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Emerging without adequate observation | Rushing, or assuming it is clear because it looked clear earlier | Stop at every closed junction; look right, left, right before committing to emerge |
| Approaching too fast for the junction | Not identifying the junction early enough | Scan further ahead — junction signs, road markings, and gaps in buildings are early warnings |
| Wrong road position on approach | Not thinking about position until the last moment | Apply MSP (mirror, signal, position) well before you need to reduce speed |
| Stalling at a give way line | Applying brake while still in a high gear | Select an appropriate gear for the speed you plan to approach at — usually 2nd or 1st |
| Emerging into the path of an oncoming vehicle | Misjudging the speed or distance of approaching traffic | If you are not certain it is safe, wait. There will always be another gap. |

## Practice Tips

**Count your junction approaches during every lesson.** Each junction is an opportunity to practise the full MSPSL routine. Approach every one with the same deliberate process, whether you are in a lesson or not.

**Narrate your observations at closed junctions.** Saying aloud "I can see clear to the right, I can see clear to the left, safe to emerge" builds the habit and makes your thinking visible to your instructor for feedback.

**Learn to identify closed vs open junctions early.** The ability to classify a junction from a distance — and therefore know whether you must plan to stop — is a mark of developing hazard perception. Practice spotting the signs: walls, parked cars, hedges, or the absence of a long sight line.

**Practice right turns at busy crossroads.** Position, wheel alignment while waiting, and timing the gap are all skills that need repetition in real traffic to become confident.

**Debrief every junction after your lesson.** Ask your instructor: were there any junctions today where I could have been better? This kind of active reflection accelerates your progress.

## Track Your Progress

Junction skills — along with every other DVSA competency — can be tracked lesson by lesson in MyDriveSchool. Because junctions appear so frequently during normal driving, your competency data builds up quickly, giving you and your instructor a clear picture of your development and where to focus next.
