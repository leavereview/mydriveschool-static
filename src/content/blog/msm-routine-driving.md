Every safe driving decision starts with knowing what is around you. The Mirror-Signal-Manoeuvre (MSM) routine is the system the DVSA uses to assess whether you are building an accurate picture of the road before you act. Get this right and you will not only pass your test — you will drive safely for life.

## What Examiners Look For

Your examiner will be watching your mirror use throughout the entire test, not just at junctions. They want to see that you check your mirrors regularly as a matter of habit — roughly every 5 to 8 seconds on a clear road — so that you always have an up-to-date picture of what is behind and alongside you.

Crucially, examiners are looking for you to **act on** what you see. Glancing at a mirror and then pulling out in front of a close vehicle scores no better than not checking at all. The information needs to influence your decision.

Before any manoeuvre — turning left or right, pulling away, changing lanes, overtaking, slowing down — you must check the interior mirror first, then the relevant door mirror. For example, moving to the right requires interior then right door mirror. Pulling up near a parked cyclist requires interior then left door mirror.

Examiners also note whether you use mirrors when you slow down or stop. Many learners only check ahead when braking and forget that a vehicle behind may be following too close — this is a common source of serious faults at test.

## The 5 DVSA Levels for Mirror Use

### Level 1: Introduced
You understand that mirrors exist and can name the interior and door mirrors. You may check them occasionally but without a consistent routine.

### Level 2: Helped
With prompting from your instructor, you remember to check mirrors before manoeuvres. The habit is not yet automatic and you need reminders.

### Level 3: Prompted
You check mirrors most of the time but need occasional verbal or visual cues from your instructor. You are developing the routine but it is not yet fully independent.

### Level 4: Independent
You apply the MSM routine consistently without reminders. Mirrors are checked before every manoeuvre and regularly on the open road. You act on the information you gather.

### Level 5: Reflection
Test-ready standard. You check mirrors naturally and continuously, adapt your driving to what you see, and can explain why you made each decision. You also check mirrors after manoeuvres to confirm the situation has resolved safely.

## The MSM Routine in Detail

### Interior Mirror: The Big Picture

The interior (rear-view) mirror gives you an overview of everything directly behind you. It shows following distances, vehicle speeds, and whether anything is closing in fast. Always start here because it gives you context before you look to the sides.

### Right Door Mirror: Right Turns, Overtaking, and Lane Changes

Check the right door mirror before turning right, moving out to pass a parked vehicle, or changing lanes to the right. It shows your blind spot less than the interior mirror and gives a clearer view of vehicles overtaking or sitting in the lane beside you.

### Left Door Mirror: Left Turns and Cyclists

The left door mirror is essential before turning left or pulling over. It is particularly important for cyclists, who often ride in the gutter or just outside your left door. Failing to check the left mirror before a left turn or opening a door is one of the most dangerous oversights a new driver can make.

### Applying the Routine

The sequence is always: **Interior → Door Mirror → Signal (if needed) → Manoeuvre**. Do not rush the mirror checks to get to the signal quickly. A genuine check takes 1 to 2 seconds per mirror. If you are uncertain about what you saw, check again before proceeding.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | The Fix |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Checking mirrors but not acting on the information | Treating mirror checks as a box-ticking exercise | Ask yourself: "What did I see and does it change what I do?" |
| Forgetting to check the left mirror for cyclists | Left mirror feels less important than right | Add a "cyclists?" mental prompt every time you move left |
| Not checking mirrors when slowing or stopping | Focus shifts forward when braking | Include a mirror check as the first step whenever you touch the brake |
| Checking only once instead of interior + door | Rushing the routine | Verbalise the sequence quietly ("interior... right door...") until it is automatic |
| Not checking mirrors after a manoeuvre | Manoeuvre feels complete once it starts | Build in a post-manoeuvre glance to confirm everything is clear |

## Practice Tips

**Set a mirror-check rhythm on quiet roads.** On a straight, low-traffic road, practise checking the interior mirror every 5 seconds by count. This builds the habit before you add the complexity of junctions and traffic.

**Narrate your checks in lessons.** Saying "interior — vehicle behind at 4 car lengths, door mirror — clear" out loud forces you to process the information rather than just move your eyes.

**Use junctions as trigger points.** Every time you approach a junction, say "MSM" in your head as a checklist. This stops you skipping the routine when you are concentrating on positioning or signals.

**Watch your following distance.** The closer you are to the vehicle ahead, the less time you have to react — and the less useful your mirrors become. Keep at least a 2-second gap so your mirror picture stays useful.

**Review dashcam footage.** If your instructor uses a dashcam, watch back your lessons and count how often you checked mirrors. Seeing the gaps yourself is far more effective than being told about them.

## Track Your Progress

Mirrors are one of the most frequently failed DVSA competencies because they are assessed continuously, not just at specific points. Logging your mirror checks after each lesson — noting where you did well and where you forgot — turns vague feedback into a clear improvement plan.

MyDriveSchool's progress tracking lets instructors mark each DVSA skill level after every lesson, so you can see your mirror use climb from Level 2 to Level 5 over time.
