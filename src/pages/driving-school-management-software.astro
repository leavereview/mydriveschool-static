        <h2 id="student-management" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Student Management</h2>

        <p>Managing student information effectively is at the core of every successful driving school. Good software makes this effortless.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Student Profiles</h3>

        <p>Each student should have a comprehensive profile containing:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> Phone, email, address, emergency contacts</li>
          <li><strong>Permit/licence details:</strong> Issue date, expiry, restrictions</li>
          <li><strong>Lesson history:</strong> Every lesson attended with instructor notes</li>
          <li><strong>Progress tracking:</strong> Skills mastered, areas needing work, hours completed</li>
          <li><strong>Documents:</strong> Scanned permits, signed waivers, certificates</li>
          <li><strong>Payment history:</strong> Packages purchased, lessons used, balance remaining</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Progress Tracking</h3>

        <p>Track student progress against a structured curriculum:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Hours completed vs. required</li>
          <li>Skills checklist (bay parking, roundabouts, motorway, etc.)</li>
          <li>Instructor assessments after each lesson</li>
          <li>Test readiness indicators</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This helps instructors pick up where others left off and gives students (and parents) visibility into progress.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Parent Portal</h3>

        <p>For teen students, parents often need involvement. A parent portal allows them to:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>View upcoming and past lessons</li>
          <li>See progress reports and instructor feedback</li>
          <li>Book and reschedule lessons</li>
          <li>Make payments and view balances</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="payments" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Payments & Billing</h2>

        <p>Managing money shouldn't be complicated. Good management software handles payments smoothly.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Online Payments</h3>

        <p>Accept card payments securely through:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Online booking (collect payment at time of booking)</li>
          <li>Student portal (pay balances anytime)</li>
          <li>Invoice links (send payment links via email/SMS)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-4 my-6">
          <p class="font-bold text-brand-navy">Prepayment reduces no-shows</p>
          <p>Students who pay in advance are significantly less likely to miss lessons. Collecting payment at booking time is the single most effective no-show prevention strategy.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Package Sales</h3>

        <p>Sell lesson packages (e.g., 10 lessons at a discount) and track:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Packages purchased and price paid</li>
          <li>Lessons used and remaining</li>
          <li>Expiry dates (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Automatic notifications when packages run low</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="instructor-management" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Instructor Management</h2>

        <p>As your school grows, managing instructors becomes more complex. Software helps you stay organised.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Instructor Profiles</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Contact information and qualifications</li>
          <li>ADI badge number and expiry</li>
          <li>Working hours and availability</li>
          <li>Assigned students and vehicles</li>
          <li>Performance metrics (pass rates, lesson counts, feedback)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Self-Service for Instructors</h3>

        <p>Give instructors their own login to:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>View their schedule on any device</li>
          <li>Access student information before lessons</li>
          <li>Record lesson notes and progress</li>
          <li>Update their availability</li>
          <li>View their performance and earnings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="reporting" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Reporting & Analytics</h2>

        <p>You can't improve what you don't measure. Good reporting helps you make better business decisions.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Essential Reports</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Revenue reports:</strong> Income by day, week, month. Compare periods. Identify trends.</li>
          <li><strong>Lesson reports:</strong> Lessons delivered, cancelled, no-shows. By instructor, by time period.</li>
          <li><strong>Student reports:</strong> New enrolments, active students, test passes, pass rates.</li>
          <li><strong>Instructor reports:</strong> Lessons per instructor, utilisation rates, pass rates, feedback scores.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Dashboard Overview</h3>

        <p>A good dashboard shows key metrics at a glance:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Today's lessons and tomorrow's schedule</li>
          <li>Revenue this week/month vs. last period</li>
          <li>No-show rate and trend</li>
          <li>Outstanding balances</li>
          <li>Test passes this month</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="choosing" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Choosing the Right Software</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">What to Look For</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Can you figure out the basics without training? Will your instructors actually use it?</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile access:</strong> Does it work well on phones? Instructors need mobile access.</li>
          <li><strong>Support:</strong> Is help available when you need it? UK-based support is a plus.</li>
          <li><strong>Pricing transparency:</strong> Are all costs clear upfront? Watch for per-user or per-SMS fees.</li>
          <li><strong>Free trial:</strong> Can you test with real scenarios before committing?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Red Flags</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Per-user pricing that makes adding instructors expensive</li>
          <li>Per-student pricing that punishes growth</li>
          <li>Hidden SMS fees that add up quickly</li>
          <li>Long contracts with no easy exit</li>
          <li>Outdated interface that instructors won't use</li>
        </ul>
