        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">What to Look For</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Can you figure out the basics without training? Will your instructors actually use it?</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile access:</strong> Does it work well on phones? Instructors need mobile access.</li>
          <li><strong>Support:</strong> Is help available when you need it? UK-based support is a plus.</li>
          <li><strong>Pricing transparency:</strong> Are all costs clear upfront? Watch for per-user or per-SMS fees.</li>
          <li><strong>Free trial:</strong> Can you test with real scenarios before committing?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Red Flags</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Per-user pricing that makes adding instructors expensive</li>
          <li>Per-student pricing that punishes growth</li>
          <li>Hidden SMS fees that add up quickly</li>
          <li>Long contracts with no easy exit</li>
          <li>Outdated interface that instructors won't use</li>
        </ul>
