          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
            We built MyDriveSchool.Software because we saw driving instructors drowning in admin work when they should be focusing on teaching.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Founded in 2024, our mission is simple: give driving schools the tools they need to run efficiently, reduce no-shows, and help more students pass their tests.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Our Values</h2>
          <ul class="space-y-3 mb-6">
            <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Software should save time, not create work</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Your diary is your business - we treat it accordingly</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> Real humans who understand driving school operations</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            We're based in the UK and serve driving schools across the UK, US, Australia, and beyond.
