  {
    question: "What is driving school software?",
    answer: "Driving school software is a management platform for ADIs and driving schools that handles lesson scheduling, student progress tracking, test date management, invoicing, and instructor allocation. It replaces spreadsheets, paper diaries, and WhatsApp coordination with a centralised system accessible from any device.",
    links: [
      { text: 'See pricing plans', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How much does driving school software cost?",
    answer: "MyDriveSchool.Software plans start from £29/month for solo ADIs with unlimited students, DVSA progress tracking, and automated reminders. Multi-instructor schools pay £79/month for up to 5 instructors with vehicle compliance tracking and business analytics. All plans include a 14-day free trial with no credit card required.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Full pricing details', url: '/pricing/' },
      { text: 'Start free trial', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can students book lessons online?",
    answer: "Students have their own secure portal where they can view upcoming and past lessons, track their DVSA competency progress, check package balances, and manage their personal details. A self-service booking widget is on our roadmap. In the meantime, the student portal significantly reduces phone calls and WhatsApp messages.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Student portal features', url: '/driving-school-management-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does it integrate with DVSA?",
    answer: "MyDriveSchool includes a built-in DVSA competency framework with 17 categories and 62+ skills. It tracks each student's proficiency on a 6-level scale (Not Started to Test Ready). This isn't a direct DVSA API integration, but a comprehensive curriculum tracking system that ensures cross-instructor continuity—any instructor can pick up exactly where the last left off.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Student progress tracking', url: '/driving-school-management-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track student progress?",
    answer: "Yes. The full DVSA competency framework tracks 62+ skills across 17 categories with a 6-level proficiency scale. After each lesson, instructors record which competencies were covered and update proficiency levels. Students see their progress through their portal, which motivates them and reduces 'When will I be ready?' questions.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Progress tracking features', url: '/driving-school-management-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does automated billing work?",
    answer: "Create lesson packages with configurable hours, pricing, and expiry dates. The system generates invoices with line items, tracks payment status through a full lifecycle, and sends invoices to students via email. Record payments via cash, bank transfer, or cheque. Online card payments via Stripe are coming soon.",
    links: [
      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Is driving school software suitable for solo ADIs?",
    answer: "Yes. Many of our users are independent ADIs who need better organisation without the complexity of enterprise software. The Solo Plan (£29/month) includes unlimited students, DVSA progress tracking, automated reminders, and invoicing—everything a solo instructor needs to run professionally.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Solo plan details', url: '/pricing/' },
      { text: 'Start free trial', url: '/contact/' }

  },
  {
    question: "Can I manage multiple instructors?",
    answer: "Yes. The School Plan (£79/month) supports up to 5 instructors with individual calendars, student assignments, vehicle allocation, and performance tracking. Each instructor gets their own login with role-based access. Enterprise plans support unlimited instructors with dedicated support and custom onboarding.",

      { text: 'Management features', url: '/driving-school-management-software/' }

  {
    question: "Does driving school software send lesson reminders?",
    answer: "Yes. Automated reminders go out via SMS (Twilio) and email (Resend) with configurable timing. You can set per-student notification preferences, and full delivery logs let you verify every message was sent and received. This reduces no-shows significantly.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Scheduling features', url: '/driving-school-scheduling-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What about vehicle tracking?",
    answer: "MyDriveSchool.Software includes vehicle compliance tracking for MOT dates, tax, and insurance expiry with automated alerts. This ensures your vehicles stay roadworthy and legally compliant. Vehicle fleet management is included in the School Plan and above.",
