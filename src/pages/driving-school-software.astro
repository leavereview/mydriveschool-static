  {
    question: "What is driving school software?",
    answer: "Driving school software is a management platform for ADIs and driving schools that handles lesson scheduling, online booking, student progress tracking, test date management, automated billing, and instructor allocation. It replaces spreadsheets, paper diaries, and WhatsApp coordination with a centralized system accessible from any device.",
    links: [
      { text: 'View all features', url: '/features/' },
      { text: 'See pricing plans', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How much does driving school software cost?",
    answer: "MyDriveSchool.Software plans start from £29/month for solo ADIs with unlimited students, online booking, and progress tracking. Multi-instructor schools pay £79/month for up to 5 instructors with fleet management and business analytics. All plans include a 14-day free trial with no credit card required.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Full pricing details', url: '/pricing/' },
      { text: 'Start free trial', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can students book lessons online?",
    answer: "Yes. Students get their own portal where they can view your availability, book lessons, reschedule, track their progress, and make payments. They receive automatic confirmations and reminders via SMS and email. Online booking reduces phone calls by 80% and lets students book lessons outside business hours.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Online booking features', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does it integrate with DVSA?",
    answer: "Yes. MyDriveSchool.Software tracks test dates, sends countdown reminders, and helps students monitor their readiness. While DVSA doesn't offer direct API integration, our system makes test date management seamless by storing test details, tracking skills coverage, and alerting you when students are approaching their test date.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Student progress tracking', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track student progress?",
    answer: "Absolutely. After each lesson, record which skills you covered (junctions, roundabouts, manoeuvres, etc.), note areas for improvement, and rate readiness. Students see their progress through their portal, which motivates them and reduces 'When will I be ready?' questions. Progress tracking also helps with test preparation.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Progress tracking features', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does automated billing work?",
    answer: "Create lesson packages (e.g., 10-hour blocks) or charge per lesson. The system generates invoices automatically, tracks payments, and sends polite reminders for overdue accounts. Accept payments via bank transfer, card, or cash. Automated billing saves 3-5 hours per week and reduces unpaid lessons by 90%.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Billing features', url: '/features/' },
      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Is driving school software suitable for solo ADIs?",
    answer: "Yes. Many of our users are independent ADIs who need better organization without the complexity of enterprise software. The Solo Plan (£29/month) includes unlimited students, online booking, progress tracking, automated reminders, and billing—everything a solo instructor needs to run professionally.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Solo plan details', url: '/pricing/' },
      { text: 'Start free trial', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can I manage multiple instructors?",
    answer: "Yes. The School Plan (£79/month) supports up to 5 instructors with individual calendars, student assignments, vehicle allocation, and performance tracking. Enterprise plans handle unlimited instructors across multiple locations. Each instructor gets their own login and can only see their assigned students.",
    links: [
      { text: 'School plan details', url: '/pricing/' },
      { text: 'Multi-instructor features', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does driving school software send lesson reminders?",
    answer: "Yes. Automated reminders go out via SMS and email 24 hours before each lesson. This reduces no-shows by 65% and cancellations by 40%. You can customize reminder timing and messaging. Students can confirm, cancel, or request changes directly from the reminder, saving you phone calls.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Reminder features', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What about vehicle and fuel tracking?",
    answer: "MyDriveSchool.Software includes vehicle management for tracking mileage, fuel consumption, maintenance schedules, and MOT dates. This is essential for claiming mileage deductions and ensuring your vehicles are roadworthy. Fleet tracking is included in the School Plan and above for managing multiple vehicles.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Vehicle tracking features', url: '/features/' },
