# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Type-check with astro check, then build static site
npm run preview  # Preview built site locally
```

## Architecture

This is a static marketing site built with **Astro 4** and **Tailwind CSS**. It generates a fully static site with no client-side JavaScript except for the mobile menu toggle.

### Project Structure

- `src/pages/` - Astro pages (file-based routing with trailing slashes)
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - Main layout with SEO meta tags, schema.org markup, and navigation/footer
- `src/components/` - Navigation and Footer components
- `src/content/blog/` - Markdown blog posts using Astro content collections
- `src/content/config.ts` - Blog collection schema (title, description, date, image, tags, author)
- `src/styles/global.css` - Tailwind base/components/utilities with custom component classes

### Key Patterns

**Brand Colors** (defined in `tailwind.config.mjs`):
- `brand-navy`: #1A1A2E (primary dark)
- `brand-red`: #E94560 (accent/CTA)
- `brand-red-light`: #FFE7EC (backgrounds)

**CSS Component Classes** (in `global.css`):
- `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-outline` - Button styles
- `.card` - Card container with hover effects
- `.section` - Standard page section padding
- `.container-custom` - Max-width container
- `.prose` - Blog content typography

**Page Types**:
- Pillar pages (e.g., `driving-school-software.astro`) - SEO landing pages
- Standard pages (about, contact, pricing)
- Blog index and dynamic `[slug].astro` for posts

## Deployment

**Direct rsync to Lightsail — no GitHub Actions, no auto-deploy.**

```bash
npm run build
rsync -avz --delete dist/ lightsail:/var/www/driveschoolpro.com/
```

Always use the `lightsail` SSH alias, not the raw IP.

## PPC Landing Pages (external contracts — do not rename or noindex)

Two pages are **Google Ads landing pages** (they also double as indexable SEO pages). Their
URLs and H1s are referenced by live Google Ads campaigns — once ads are live, treat the URLs
as **external contracts**: don't rename, move, or noindex them without updating the ads first.

- `/driving-instructor-software` — solo ADI lander (leads with Solo £22/mo)
- `/driving-school-software-uk` — multi-instructor lander (leads with School £22 + £12/extra)
  - Note the `-uk` slug: `/driving-school-software` is the existing SEO pillar and was deliberately
    kept; the lander uses a distinct slug rather than overwriting a ranking page.

Both use `LandingLayout` (no global nav — company details + GA4/Ads conversion are inherited from
the layout), link to `/compare/total-drive/`, and stay in the sitemap by default. They cross-link
(solo ↔ school) and are linked from the homepage plan cards so each satisfies `verify-seo.js`'s
≥2-inbound-internal-links rule. Pure PPC-only variants still live under `/ads/*` (noindexed).
